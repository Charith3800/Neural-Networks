## Assignment Details

This repository contains the code and documentation for Home Assignment 1. The assignment covers the following tasks:

1. **Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping**: Create, reshape, and perform operations on tensors.
2. **Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implement and evaluate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) loss functions.
3. **Training a Model with Different Optimizers**: Develop an MNIST model utilizing both Adam and SGD optimizers, and evaluate their respective performance.
4. **Training a Neural Network with TensorBoard Logging**: Develop a basic neural network utilizing the MNIST dataset and record the outcomes in TensorBoard.

The code is written in Python using TensorFlow and is provided in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files. Below are the steps to run the code locally (in Jupyter) or on Google Colab.

## Files

- `Home-Assignment-Task1&2.ipynb`: Code for Task 1 and 2.
- `Home-Assignment1-Task3.ipynb`: Code for Task 3.
